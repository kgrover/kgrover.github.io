As a graduating senior, it can sometimes be hard to have an unbiased perspective of institute policy; this is a time of transition
perhaps from a sense of frustration over the 4-year curriculum’s perceived shortcomings to a more rose-tinted retrospective view. Despite this, there remains one important piece missing from Caltech as it prepares undergraduates for the “real world”[1] : teaching communication well.

The motto of our institute is “The truth shall make you free”, and certainly we represent it by advancing science and engineering through our labs and centers everyday. However, Caltech does not  uphold its role in the community by simply ‘performing science’: we collaborate globally through direct relationships with peers and publishing in widely read journals. Being able to tell a story through science— to detail its impact and bring it out of obscurity and into public eye— is not a “plus” but rather an integral part of the pursuit. Explaining our science is not only a matter of responsibility to the community, but also a testament of our own understanding. 

In my undergraduate experience, I have taken exactly two dedicated courses (i.e. 6 units!) on communicating science/engineering:

- E 10 
- E 11

Though these are required by my CS option, core requirements require a mere 3 units for graduation. Of course, we should not understate the value of the humanities in honing our writing skills (and even then, 3 writing intensive courses are considered sufficient)— but that is a separate topic entirely. Leaving aside scope for expansion, here I simply want to address the effectiveness of the required classes.

Let me first consider E 10. E 10, I’m sure, is a well-intentioned class: the premise is that presentations are crucial to success in both academia and the workplace. I have no bone to pick with this idea: the fear of public speaking, glossophobia, has long been recognized and sometimes been considered a fundamental fear. Does E 10 accomplish its goal? Probably not. It requires students to give 3 presentations (at least one technical): a whiteboard talk, an overhead presentation, and an (electronic) slide show. The class ‘runs’ on feedback: you give the talk, the professor gives you some pointers and a comment sheet, and the world spins on. Feedback, in principle, can be extremely useful: in fact, much of the theory behind “the making of an expert” [[2]] relies on immediate and direct feedback. But there are atleast 3 missing links: basic theory, repetition, and relevance. 

If the thesis is that students are formally learning to present for the first time[3], then we ought to give them a proper grounding: what are the basic elements of speaking effectively? What captivates an audience? How do you use tone (and its modulations)? E 10 should not be about ‘practicing’ presenting, but rather about ‘teaching’ presenting (which involves the former). 

More problematically— even if we want to jump to practice— there is simply no way for a student to grow in 3 discrete and stylistically different presentations spaced out by 2 weeks each. Mistakes of whiteboard usage or posture at the overhead do not help wth the organization of a slideshow. Even if I have mumbled through my first couple presentations, I cannot tease out the source of this via two data points (was I nervous? did I not understand the material? is this media style inappropriate for this topic?).

Most of us tend to care more about classes that feel useful to us [4]. E 10, in the name of flexibility and the philosophy of being “content invariant”, encourages us to speak about any topic. Ideally, this should push content out of focus and help us concentrate on communication skills only, but this is a mistaken thought. Presentations are structured around and reliant on content in a deep way: a talk on dollar bill origami will necessarily face different issues than a talk on protein folding, even if they use the same overhead projector. I suspect many presentation issues are specific to the relationship between me and my content: suppose I am an expert in mobile development. When giving a talk on developing for iOS as a beginner speaker, I will have a hard time preventing jargon from creeping in and adapting it appropriately for the audience. Talking about frivolous topics is a recipe for ignoring underlying problems, and also comes at the cost of students feeling that E 10 is not relevant to their ‘real work’. Since presentations will be essential for any working graduate, there should be no excuse for failing to demonstrate their relevance directly.

E 10, if I have spelled its intentions out correctly, will not work in its current format. It needs to be designed in a more field-aware way and allow for rich feedback mechanisms. 

We can tackle E 11 on similar lines. E 11 is concerned with technical writing [5], consists of a one-hour weekly lecture, and requires students to work on a single paper’s components throughout the term (review paper on any topic, or past conducted research). My main criticism of E 11 is actually one that it attempts to instill in the students of the class as a common pitfall of writing: it fails to account for its audience. E 11 students, for the most part, are engineers [6] and more generally (like most students), students with heavy workload in other classes. The incentives here just do not add up: the class does not properly motivate writing, and it’s inevitably tempting to write on a topic you’re extremely familiar with in order to ‘maintain clarity’ and speed through a 3-unit class. In reality, of course, writing a review paper on your favorite topic is not useful for writing skills: you are unlikely to find that level of comfort in the future. More pressingly, a points-based system in any class does not lend itself to the painful process of re-writing unless there are auxiliary motivations for wanting to get it right. Writing for the sake of writing is artificial. In the real world, writing is about convincing someone (to give you money, a promotion, a deal, etc) or creating and promoting understanding (but only when you see intrinsic value in the matter). Convincing a teacher to give me points is, unfortunately, not the correct reward system here [7]. Similar to E 10, E 11 needs to be integrated into other classes where students have these other sorts of motivations to write and re-write. Manufacturing interest is an implausible burden, especially  for a 3-unit course. 

We expect students here at Caltech to have an innate curiosity[8], but discovery turns to obscurity if it’s not communicated well. Presenting and writing, if taught correctly, have the potential to significantly boost the impact our graduates can make. This begins with rethinking how E 10 and E 11 fit into our 4-year curriculum.
