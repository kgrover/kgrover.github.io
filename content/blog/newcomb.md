Newcomb's paradox is interesting because the philosophical community is
split on it almost evenly. [[1]]

I just want to introduce the problem here, and not make my own argument. In particular, I want to [see what you think](https://goo.gl/forms/gSJb4qU7GrfpwO333) after reading the problem setup. I will detail _very basic_ arguments, though.

Suppose you're walking in the forest towards a small hut. Inside this hut,
there is a wizard who can predict your actions with impeccable accuracy and
has set up a game for you to play with two boxes. A few paces before you enter,
you find a note from the wizard buried in the dirt with the rules of the game.

Here's what the wizard has written on this note:


> Inside, to your right, you will find one glass transparent box that contains $1,000. There is another box to your left which either contains nothing or $1,000,000. This one is made of cardboard, so you can't see inside, but I promise you I've made my decision about the dollar amount in this box as I saw you coming a mile away. Come in and take either one or both boxes, but choose carefully.

You walk forward and uncover another note:


> Ah, but it's not so simple, and I owe you an explanation of how I placed the money. When I made my decision, I predicted your behavior. If I predicted that you were going to choose both boxes, I left nothing in the cardboard box. If I predicted you were going to choose only the cardboard box, I put $1,000,000 in it.

You walk in, and are faced with the decision. What's the right move? [I'd love to hear your thoughts](https://goo.gl/forms/gSJb4qU7GrfpwO333).

## Take only the Cardboard box
Suppose the wizard, as he claims, is really a perfect predictor of your behavior.
Then, you should plan to take _only_ the cardboard box, because he will predict as such
and place $1,000,000 in it. You walk away from the situation with $1,000,000.

## Take both boxes
No matter what the wizard has _already_ predicted, taking both boxes will give you a
higher return. This is simple to see: if he has predicted that you're going to
take both boxes, then you ought to do exactly this and get your $1,000. If he has
predicted that you'll take just the cardboard box, then you can outsmart him
and get the best possible outcome: $1,001,000.

## Discussion

- You can just reject the claim that a perfect predictor is possible. How does your
answer change if the wizard is correct 99% of the time?
- Does your answer depend on any temporal dynamics of the game? Does it matter
if the wizard predicts _after_ you walk into the hut?
- Does it help or is it fair to split the problem into pre- and post-decision
stages?
- What if the predictor could somehow _run_ the algorithm that your brain uses
to make the decision?
