<h3 id="assumptions-and-argument">Assumptions and Argument</h3>

<p>In this paper, I want to consider the topic of sex-selective abortion (SSA), and how it relates to abortion on the basis of a genetic disability (DBA). We seem to prima facie accept the following two propositions:</p>

<p>(1*) Abortion on the basis of a disability (e.g. down’s syndrome) is morally permissible.</p>

<p>(2*) Abortion based on the sex of the fetus is morally impermissible, or unjust.</p>

<p>I will primarily argue for what I call the consistent stance: there is no morally relevant difference between SSA and DBA. In particular, the consistent stance holds that we should hold equivalent evaluative criteria for SSA and DBA. Note that the consistent stance does not imply a normative attitude about the ‘average’ case of SSA or DBA in a specific society, but rather states that there is nothing in principle (i.e. inherently) morally different about the two policies. I will also attempt to advance the secondary argument that most cases of DBA and SSA are indeed morally permissible.</p>

<h3 id="diagnosing-the-difference">Diagnosing the difference</h3>

<p>Let’s begin by considering perhaps the most emotionally forceful argument to think that SSA is by nature distinct from DBA: it is often asserted that (2<em>) follows obviously from an unjust and inherent prejudice against a sex, whereas (1</em>) does not derive from any such prejudice. I imagine that the argument, which I will term the charge of sexism, goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Discrimination on the sole basis of sex (sexism) is morally impermissible.</p></li>

<li><p>Aborting a fetus based on its sex (SSA), determined through prenatal testing, is motivated by sexism on the part of the parents.</p></li>

<li><p>SSA is morally impermissible.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I would first like to point out that we can conclude (3) directly by this argument only if (2) is strengthened to say that SSA is motivated only by sexism[1]. I accept the first premise, but not without concern. Normally, we think that sexism is wrong (at least in part) because there are persons who are negatively affected by the belief, or whose rights are violated. This is not obvious here: whether the fetus is a person who has rights is a contentious topic in the abortion debate, and something I return to later in this essay[2]. It is not clear that our intuitions of ‘unfairness’ and ‘oppression’ should give the same weight as usual. To assess the applicability, consider Parfit’s classic examples of possible people[3]. If a couple chooses to use contraception on the notion that there is a 50% chance of having a female child, does the charge of sexism subject them to the same moral judgment? Do we feel they are sexist to the possible person they might have conceived? If you think there is some reason to be less harsh, then I suggest that your objection does not entirely stem from the charge of sexism, but rather objections to abortion as a practice. Yet, to give credit to the proponent of the charge of sexism, I admit that we can defend (1) by looking at the issue in a Kantian sense. We could not make sexism a maxim and still expect a functioning society. Let’s now move to the more problematic premise: (2) seems to simply be a false assumption in most instances of SSA. We will consider plenty of cases in which SSA can be justified by genuine concerns of suffering or preferences of the parents.</p>

<p>But the question remains: what are we to think of abortion which is carried out merely due to the sex of the fetus (i.e. genuine sexism)? Here, I will be willing to bite the bullet and concede that this alone does not form proper grounds for abortion. However, I propose that this is no different from the case of DBA. If we frame the analogous argument for DBA, it would imply that aborting for the mere reason of a fetus having a disability is wrong. Surely, any serious defender of (1*) would agree that aborting a fetus likely to develop myopia — justified purely because the fetus is disabled — is not morally sufficient[4]. My point, then, is that in the case of disability, we tend to assume underlying moral reasons ‘for free’: the degraded quality of life, the suffering, and so on. Just because we cannot make these intuitive jumps for SSA should not cloud our judgment when evaluating SSA — and we certainly should not assume that SSA can only be motivated by sexism. The couple who appeals only to the sex of the fetus will share the same moral position as the couple who appeals only to the fact that the fetus is disabled (in both cases, we may reasonably ask for some morally relevant account of why the sex or disability allows for abortion). The charge of sexism does not undermine the consistent stance.</p>

<p>A second argument that is often used to defend (2*) is that the sex being selected against — regardless of what reasons the parents might have — is degraded and thus this practice perpetuates sexual inequity in society. Note that this is distinct from the charge of sexism: this argument describes a net detriment to others in society, and applies more broadly even when the parents have morally ‘defensible’ reasons. I would like to note that this type of argument is also extremely common in the literature of DBA, giving the consistent stance some plausibility[5]. This argument (termed the expressivist argument) can be generalized to the following points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Abortion on the basis of trait x wrongly minimizes a fetus (or perhaps the individual that will develop from the fetus) to a representation of only x.</p></li>

<li><p>By allowing abortions of this type, we are sending ‘hurtful’ or ‘discriminatory’ messages to persons in society with trait x.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that my primary burden here is to defend the idea that the above points hold no special weight whether x is the sex of the fetus or a disability diagnosis. It might be thought that a characteristic like sex cannot be inherently harmful to an individual or entirely determine her life trajectory, whereas a disability will often cause intense suffering and limit the opportunities available to the individual. If this were true, then point (1) would only be an ‘unfair’ representation in the case of SSA and not DBA. Such a notion comes from a presumptive attitude that lacks proper justification. Imagine a society where females are systematically oppressed, given few opportunities for social mobility, and do not possess any of the basic rights of expression, representation, and so on. A woman’s life in this society is limited by her sex as much as (if not more) than a disabled child is limited by a disability. You need not buy my specific description (for example, you might require that the sex of the individual significantly limit lifespan as in the case of disability): my point is only that there is nothing intrinsic about a disability that allows it to bypass point (1) of the expressivist argument whereas sex cannot. The reply I anticipate here is that a disability such as down’s syndrome is an absolute bad whereas sex-based disadvantages are a result of social prejudices that can be resolved[6]. As Asch argues, this is an ill-informed view on the part of the ethicist. Individuals with serious disabilities go through life quite happily and think of their own lives as rich and rewarding. If anything, it is others’ attitudes and the lack of societal support that causes the vast majority of reported dissatisfaction[7]. I want to return to myopia: in this case, we no longer even have the pressing intuition that this is a disability because society is extremely well-equipped with prescriptive eyewear. Such an account of disability as a social paradigm, much like sex prejudice, should motivate the idea that the expressivist argument against abortion holds equal force for both cases if it holds at all. This is sufficient to salvage the consistent stance.</p>

<p>I want to put forth some reasons to reject the expressivist account outright: James Nelson, Edwards, and various others have argued strongly here[8], so I will only give a brisk rehearsal to make my point. A core tenet of the expressivist is that each fetus is more than just x (where x is the sex or the disability). Therefore we should treat their birth and life in the full, proper context. The expressivist is caught in a self-defeating stance, as precisely this idea refutes point (2): each family will have different reasons why trait x bears on their situation. To put the point extremely, if x is the property of being the fourth child, surely aborting that child does not signal to other fourth children that their lives are any less valuable[9]. Similarly, it is unfair to characterize a family that already has a disabled first child but aborts another fetus prenatally diagnosed with down’s syndrome as expressing any sort of discriminatory attitudes or less love for the first child. Aborting a girl because of past parental trauma involving their last child does not undermine the womanhood of existing persons. I think Savulescu puts this point most clearly when he says that SSA (and, equally DBA) takes action against the trait because of its effects on well-being, but refuses to make value judgments about individuals with x[10].</p>

<p>The last major argument I want to briefly address is the eugenics argument: it is supposed that SSA is a significant step towards selective ‘cleansing’ and control over future generations whereas DBA is not. I think a defense of this follows naturally from our discussion above. Proponents of the eugenics stance fail to bear the burden of proof: in what morally relevant sense is sex a characteristic that is more trivial than a disability? I have already argued above that SSA does not have to stem from inconsiderate or offhand reasons, and I have aimed to show in a rebuttal of the expressivist stance that SSA does not imply value judgments about the opposing sex. We cannot draw the notion of ‘systematic cleansing’ from an individual woman exercising her right to reproductive choice. Moreover, an important component of eugenics requires that it is institutionalized or at least coordinated; in the cases relevant to our present discussion, neither SSA nor DBA meet this requirement.</p>

<h3 id="the-permissibility-of-abortion-11">The Permissibility of Abortion[11]</h3>

<p>In this section, I want to offer the viewpoint of Tooley to strengthen the case I have already made in defense of SSA and DBA. These arguments are more general, so I will not address SSA and DBA separately.</p>

<p>Tooley’s stance is well-known as an argument about personhood[12]. To appreciate his view, we should start from the most basic conservative stance on abortion that Tooley wants to analyze:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Killing an innocent human being is wrong.</p></li>

<li><p>A fetus is innocent.</p></li>

<li><p>Killing a fetus is wrong.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Tooley claims that the use of ‘human being’ in the first premise deserves clarification. Surely, it cannot be homo sapiens as that would unjustifiably give special status to our species (and is thereby speciesist). Rather, he claims that humans are thought to have some right to life because of their status as persons. Tooley makes the case that a person is someone who has a sense of self-identity lasting over time (“self consciousness”). Moreover, we cannot take away this right from a being that does not have the desire (or conception) of this kind of consciousness. Using this vein of argument, Tooley justifies abortion (and, in fact, infanticide) by saying that a fetus is not mentally developed enough to desire a continued existence as one being over time, and is thereby not a person. Thus, killing a fetus is not wrong, and both SSA and DBA can be justified (whether or not the fetus grows up to become a person).</p>

<p>Disagreement with Tooley generally hinges on the potentiality principle. Since a fetus will (in the normal course of events) grow to become a person with a sense of sustained identity and thus rights, a defender of a fetus’ right to life will claim that it is morally wrong to abort. Though Tooley himself gives an analogy in an attempt to salvage his account, I find the arguments of Singer and Parfit more compelling as they come with less substantive assumptions[13]. In particular, Singer argues against the potential person intuition from two angles[14]:</p>

<p>(1) It is not obvious that we should accept as a rule that a potential x has the same rights as an x. To give my own analogy, an heir to the king does not have the same rights as the king himself.</p>

<p>(2) Suppose we are to take the stance that a potential person constitutes a major loss to society in virtue of their future contributions. This commits us to counterintuitive views: in particular, we must accept that contraception leads to the same sorts of losses, whereas abortions where we instead give birth at another time (hence a 1:1 tradeoff in ‘potential people’) do not.</p>

<p>It seems, then, that arguing against Tooley on the basis of the potential of a fetus is well-refuted by these considerations.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>In this paper, I have chiefly aimed to defend the following:</p>

<p>Consistent Stance: There is no inherent difference between sex-selective abortion (SSA) and disability-based abortion (DBA).</p>

<p>I have given reasons to believe that the charge of prejudice (sexism), the expressivist argument, and the eugenics stance imply the same moral status for both DBA and SSA. More strongly, in each case, I have argued that serious cases of DBA and SSA should be justified. Independently, I have pursued and defended Tooley’s argument in defense of abortion.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by now assessing our prima facie intuitions if we are to accept the consistent stance (suppose, for the moment, that we are unconvinced of my secondary argument on non-selective abortion’s permissibility). I suggest that the results of this discussion lead us here:</p>

<ol>
<li>We have no reason to believe, without considering the reasons underlying a case of SSA or DBA, that either will naturally hold a higher moral status than the other.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, I want to emphasize that (1<em>) and (2</em>) need not be completely mistaken, especially in western society. It is perfectly possible that in principle SSA and DBA share the moral status while still holding that there might be fewer cases of SSA in a society where we can meet this uniform moral criteria. Yet, we should abandon a priori notions that SSA is somehow inherently worse for society (in that it promotes gender-inequality or eugenics), or that it is necessarily motivated by sexism.</p>

<p>[1] There might be other defensible principles for why SSA is justified, and so (3) will not follow from (1) and (2) alone.</p>
